This project was bootstrapped with [Create KaiOS App](https://github.com/jzhangs/create-kaios-app).

It's a pure javascript KaiOS app, but still uses kaios-scripts to build and pack the app. The build step will place the bundled scripts under 'src/' folder into the `<body>` tag.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn push`

Install the app in `build` folder to KaiOS devices.
